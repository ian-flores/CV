Data Scientist with experience and working with government and in academia. I have a strong focus on reproducible, transparent and accessible data science and statistics. I am particularly interested by the use of open data and open source technologies to solve social problems with applied statistics. Interested in contributing to society with data science tools I would like to follow a career in which the work I do has a direct positive impact over people's lives.}
