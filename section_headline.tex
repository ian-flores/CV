Data Scientist with experience in the government sector and academia. I have a strong focus on reproducibility, accountability and transparency in data science. I am particularly interested by the use of open data and open source technologies to solve social problems in the realm of education, health, crime and privacy. Interested in contributing to society with data science tools I would like to follow a career in which the work I do has a direct positive impact over people's lives.
